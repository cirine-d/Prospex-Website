          The leafy mansions of the upper middle classes – and the low-income

        <hr />
        <p>
          In one in three Islington households, no-one is employed. Over half of
          single parents in the borough – mostly mothers – are out of work. Just
          a fifth are in full employment, half the national average. The borough
          has the highest recorded prevalence of depression and severe mental
          illness in London. It is highly overpopulated, with triple as many
          people per square metre as the average London borough, and the second
          lowest proportion of green space. It’s also full of young people with
          drive, creativity, ideas – and enormous potential. But without safe
          green spaces, playgrounds, or youth centres, they have nowhere to
          grow. And without the financial freedom to travel to other areas of
          the city, they cannot benefit from better local provisions elsewhere.

              Young people want places to go. In Islington, they have a number
              of options, but few of them are free. Community centres in estates
              have been closed, or are being redeveloped. Many don’t feel safe
              travelling to the places which remain open because of high
              incidence of crime or antisocial behaviour. Prospex gives them
              somewhere to learn, play, or just relax – closer to home. Our
              youth hubs offer a safe space for young people to meet new people,
              learn new skills, and enjoy themselves in an environment designed
              to promote positive wellbeing. We have a ‘Healthy Bodies, Healthy
              Minds’ approach – stimulating both the physical body, and the
              mind. We run regular cooking, gardening, arts and crafts, team
              building, and personal development sessions, coupled with sports,
              physical activity and trips to the countryside. Whatever they feel
              like doing, whoever they are, and whoever they wish to be, we want
              every young person to find a home at Prospex.
